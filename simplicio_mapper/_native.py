"""Optional Rust acceleration shim.

When the companion ``simplicio_mapper_rs`` Rust extension is installed (built
with maturin from the ``rust/`` directory), the mapper uses it for content
hashing and import parsing. Otherwise the pure-Python implementations in
``mapper`` are used. The Python package always works without the extension —
this module simply exposes whether the native fast path is available.
